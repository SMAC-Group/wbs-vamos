        ### Scientific abstract

        Forecasting the precise time at which volcanic eruptions occur is not possible. However, estimating the potential magnitude (total erupted mass) of future eruptions and the potential duration of long lasting eruptions are achievable targets but remain two of the great challenges in the Earth Sciences.

        Eruptions sample magma from the plumbing system of volcanoes and bring to the surface the only direct witnesses of magmatic processes occurring at inaccessible depths of few to tens of kilometres. A variety of information is recorded in the chemistry of erupted magma, minerals and melt. Geologists use experiments performed at high temperatures and pressures, and numerical modelling to “translate” the chemical signals contained in volcanic rocks into pre-eruptive magmatic processes. This allows the retrieval of constraints on the depths from which the magma feeding an eruption is sourced, the temperature distribution of the erupted magma, the chemical complexity of magmas distributed within the plumbing system and the timescales of magma ascent to the surface.

        While these information are essential to our understanding of pre-eruptive processes, forecasting the potential magnitude of volcanic eruptions requires quantitative estimates of the distribution of temperature and eruptible magma within volcanic plumbing systems for eruptions of different magnitude that occurred over the history of the same volcano. Estimates of the duration of eruptions can be achieved by studying the variation of mineral and glass chemistry over the course of well studied eruptions (e.g. Tajogaite - La Palma, 2021), as preliminary data we collected for the 2014-2015 eruption of Bardarbunga-Holuhraun suggest.

        VAMOS uses information retrieved from mineral and glass chemistry as the target of numerical and statistical inversion modelling to link the thermal and chemical architecture of volcanic plumbing systems and the magnitude of well-studied past eruptions. On the base of these results, we will identify patterns in the erupted record heralding eruptions of different magnitudes. To estimate eruption duration, we will invert chemical information on samples collected during past eruptions (e.g. 2021 eruption of Tajogaite) using numerical and statistical modelling, to define the best proxies identifying the waning stage of eruptions.

        VAMOS will finally establish a workflow to estimate the magnitude and duration of future eruptions. The achievement of the targets of VAMOS will open a new frontier of research and produce results that combined with monitoring and geophysics will contribute to the quantitative assessment of volcanic hazard by allowing the determination of the magnitude of an eruption before it actually occurs and the estimation of its duration while it unfolds. Estimating the duration of a volcanic eruption would be essential for decision makers to select the measures to take during a volcanic eruption. This is evident in instances such as the 2021 eruptions of Tajogaite volcano in La Palma (Canary Archipelago), where estimates of the eruption magnitude and its duration would have been of enormous help for the planning of volcanic impact mitigation measures.
